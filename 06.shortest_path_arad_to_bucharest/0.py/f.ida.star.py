# Given a road map of part of Romania with road distances in miles and the straight-line distances to Bucharest provided in a table, determine the shortest path from Arad to Bucharest. 

# Implement and compare the following search algorithms:

# a. Depth-First Search (DFS)
# b. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
# c. Depth-Limited Search
# d. Iterative Deepening Search
# e. A* Search, Uniform Cost Search
# f. Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*)
# g. Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS)
# h. and Greedy Best-First Search
# i. Evaluate each algorithm's effectiveness in finding the shortest path from Arad to Bucharest
